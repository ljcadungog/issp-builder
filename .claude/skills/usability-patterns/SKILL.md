# Usability Patterns — How Carlos Wants Systems Designed

A living document. Every principle below was extracted from a real correction or review
finding in this project. When Carlos gives new usability feedback, **add the principle here
with its incident** — don't just fix the instance.

## How Carlos runs a usability check (the method)

He walks the real flow **as a first-time end user** (an agency focal person, not a
developer), narrating what he can and cannot see. The recurring questions:

1. **"Did the user see what just happened?"** — every action must have a visible
   consequence at the point of attention (not below the fold, not implied).
2. **"Would they know what this means without asking?"** — labels judged against a
   first-time user with zero developer context.
3. **"What happens to old/existing data?"** — he loads old files and pre-existing
   documents against new features; hidden or hidden-by-default data is a bug.
4. **"Where do I manage this state?"** — any state the app holds (drafts, caches, links)
   must have a visible place to inspect and clear it.

He checks in passes: one concern at a time across the whole builder (e.g. one pass for
input-control fit, one for label clarity, one for add/edit/delete flows). Findings go in a
dated audit doc with severity tiers, then a phased fix plan he approves before any code.

## The principles

### 1. Visible consequence — never add silently
**Incident:** III-D/E "Add Project" appended a card below existing ones; user didn't know
anything was added ("hindi alam na may na-add na pala sa ibaba").
**Rule:** Adding an item happens in a focused surface (modal/drawer — see Part IV's
LineItemDrawer, the house exemplar), or at minimum the new item is scrolled into view with
its first input focused. Off-screen mutations are bugs.

### 2. Read and edit are different modes
**Incident:** III-E project accordions opened fully editable; reading required wading
through inputs, and accidental edits were one keystroke away.
**Rule:** Lists of rich objects open **collapsed**; expanding shows a **read-optimized
view** (label/value rows, checked-only summaries, formatted numbers — not disabled inputs);
editing is an explicit action (Edit button → drawer or edit mode). Default to viewing.
**Sharpening (Carlos, 2026-06-13):** the card *header* already shows the object's identity
(title + status/classification badges). Do **not** also render an always-visible "quick row"
of those same fields as live inputs above the collapsible body — it duplicates the header
*and* leaves identity editable in read/collapsed state (one stray keystroke renames the card).
Identity fields (name, classification, status, type) live **inside the edit-mode form only**;
the header carries them for read and collapsed states. Applied across II-C, III-D, III-E.

### 3. Labels answer source, consequence, audience
**Incident:** III-A's "Current" badge (silently mirrored from Part II-B) and the bare
"Proposed" checkbox; fixed as "Already in place (per Part II-B)" + "Strengthen / upgrade"
vs "Propose to add" (commit `41b5c70`).
**Rule:** Every label/badge/checkbox must say (a) **where the value comes from** if
derived ("per Part II-B", "auto-calculated"), (b) **what acting on it means** (verb
phrases, not nouns), (c) in words a first-time focal person understands — prefer the
official template's own vocabulary.

### 4. Cross-references warn, by name, verbosely
**Incident:** linking a proposed IS already linked to another project gave no signal;
double-counting risk invisible.
**Rule:** When an action creates a second relationship to something already claimed,
name the existing counterpart and explain the risk before applying ("X is already linked
to Project SIKAP… budget and KPIs may be double-counted. Link anyway?"). Indicators that
say *that* something is linked must also say *to what*.

### 5. Destruction is two-step, sized to the loss
**Incident:** one mis-tap deleted a fully-filled IS card (~20 fields) instantly.
**Rule:** Container objects get a two-tap confirm (armed "Confirm?" state, 3 s timeout);
deletes with downstream casualties name them ("Delete project + its KPIs/budget?"). Small
rows stay instant — friction proportional to what's lost.

### 6. The app's hidden state must be self-evident and manageable
**Incident:** returning to the splash screen with work in IndexedDB showed a generic
landing page — no sign of the draft, no way to clear it outside the editor.
**Rule:** Wherever the app holds state for the user, the entry point must surface it
("Continue where you left off" + metadata: title, last edited, completion) and offer the
same management actions (clear, with two-step confirm) available elsewhere.

### 7. Old data must survive — and stay visible — through schema changes
**Incidents:** classification enums never matching the PDF; freeform `projectType` hiding
the linked-systems picker on old files.
**Rule:** See the schema-change skill: map historical values, derive gating fields from
the data they gate, test by loading a pre-change `.issp` and confirming everything is
visible without touching a control.

### 8. Derived/copied data may never go stale
**Incidents:** stored project-title copies printing old names in the PDF; CIO→focal
one-time copy diverging from the live CIO fields; III-E "Total Project Cost" was a
user-typed input duplicating the sum of the project's Part IV resource requirements —
the demo file had already drifted (stored ₱24.5M vs actual ₱20.875M) and the "must match
Part IV" copy asked the user to do the reconciliation by hand.
**Rule:** Store ids, resolve display values live at render/export. If a mirror flag
exists ("same as CIO"), keep the mirror in sync on every write *and* derive at export as
a backstop. Stronger form: **if the app can compute a value from data it already holds,
never ask the user to type it** — show the derived value read-only with an ⓘ naming the
source section ("Auto-calculated from this project's resource requirements in Part IV"),
and drop the stored field from the schema so it cannot drift.

### 9. Compact UI, honest affordances
**Standing preferences:** desktop stays dense (standard Tailwind p-2/p-3; touch sizes only
under `pointer: coarse`); left-aligned nav; no decorative controls — a drag handle that
doesn't drag is a lie, remove it. Card/list titles use `line-clamp-2 break-words`, not
`truncate` — single-line truncation cuts names even where vertical room exists (Carlos,
2026-06-12); reserve `truncate` for genuinely single-line rows (nav items, table cells,
badges with hover tooltips). Watch the grid + nowrap trap: a truncated child inside a CSS
grid needs `min-w-0` on the grid item or the nowrap min-content blows the layout out.

### 10. Format in the field, not beside it
**Incident:** large peso inputs (III-E Total Project Cost, Part IV Unit Cost) got a
"= ₱150,000,000.00" echo line *below* the raw input instead of the input itself being
readable. Carlos: the field should just auto-apply commas/decimals as you type.
**Rule:** Don't bolt a formatted mirror next to an unreadable control — make the control
itself present the value correctly (`NumberInput currency` prop: live digit grouping while
typing, `1,234,567.89` on blur). An echo/preview is only acceptable when it shows a
*different* piece of information (a computed total, a cross-section comparison), never a
reformatting of what the user just typed. Applies beyond money: any control whose raw
value is hard to read is the control's problem to solve.

### 11. Lead with the situation, collapse the alternatives
**Incident:** the first splash continue-card kept the full Explore/Start New/Load card stack
at equal weight below it. Carlos: with a detected session, hide those behind a button/
accordion, and demote "Explore a sample" (they're already using the tool) while keeping it
reachable.
**Rule:** when the app can detect the user's situation (a session exists, a step is done),
lead with the one action that fits it; alternatives collapse behind an explicit disclosure
("Other options…"). Demoted options stay reachable but shrink to text-link weight. If a
collapsed alternative would destroy current state (start new / load over a session), the
expanded group opens with a warning naming what gets replaced and how to keep it.

### 12. Hold a loading state through navigation, don't flash the destination
**Incident:** loading the sample ISSP (or a file, or creating a new plan) wrote to
IndexedDB and set the store doc *before* `router.push("/editor")` resolved. The splash
branches on "is there a session?", so for a frame it re-rendered into the "Continue where
you left off" card before the editor route took over — a visible flash of the wrong screen
(Carlos, 2026-06-13).
**Rule:** when an action mutates state that an earlier screen branches on *and* then
navigates away, set an explicit `navigating` flag the moment the action succeeds and hold a
loading state ("Opening the editor…") until the route changes. Never let the origin screen
re-render into its post-mutation branch mid-navigation. The flag is one-way: it only clears
by unmounting on the route change.

### 13. Overlays own the top layer — and these behaviors are defaults, not requests
**Incidents (all Carlos, 2026-06-13, in one sidebar/theme-picker pass):** the theme trigger
stayed 28px while its neighbor Save/PDF buttons grew to 40px on touch (it missed the
`coarse:` size); selecting a theme closed the sidebar but left the menu floating in its
portal; then the first outside tap that dismissed the menu also fell through and could
activate the sidebar control beneath it. Each was a separate round-trip.
**Rules — apply without being asked whenever you add a menu/popover/sheet/drawer:**
- **Touch-target & size parity:** a control sitting in a row of controls matches their box —
  including responsive/touch sizes. If neighbors are `Button size="sm"` (`h-7 coarse:h-10`),
  a sibling icon-trigger is `h-7 w-7 coarse:h-10 coarse:w-10`, not a bare `h-7 w-7`.
- **Outside taps dismiss the top layer only, and never pass through.** An open overlay
  captures the first outside tap: it closes *that overlay* and is consumed — the control
  beneath is not activated. Closing nested layers is one tap each (tap once → menu closes,
  sidebar stays; tap again → sidebar closes). Use a modal backdrop (e.g. Base UI
  `Menu.Backdrop`) stacked above the surface behind it and below the popup.
- **Match dismissal to purpose.** A picker meant for live try-on (themes) stays open on
  select so options can be compared; it does *not* close the host sheet on select. A menu of
  one-shot actions closes on select. Decide which this is before wiring it.
- **Nothing the overlay paints may linger once it's closed** — see principle 12's sibling
  case: the mobile scrim was an always-mounted `fixed inset-0` opacity toggle that left a
  tint in the dynamic-viewport edges; mount overlays/scrims only while open.

## Process expectations (how to work with these)

- **Ask once, up front, when a behavior is genuinely ambiguous — don't ship one reading and
  iterate.** Carlos (2026-06-13): repeated corrections on overlay behavior were "burning
  through tokens going back and forth … ask if you want to clarify instead of executing
  immediately." If a feature has more than one reasonable behavior (dismissal order, does a
  menu stay open, layering/z-order, which control owns a tap), pose a single concise
  question before building. Reserve this for real forks — defaults above resolve most of it.

- **Plan first:** findings → dated audit doc (severity tiers, file:line) → phased plan doc
  → explicit approval → one commit per phase, verified per the verify-feature skill.
- **Document after:** update the audit doc's status banner, `docs/project-status.md`, and
  memory after each phase.
- **Flag the family, not the instance:** when Carlos reports one bad control, grep for the
  same pattern everywhere and list the siblings in the audit doc ("flag similar items").
- **This file is append-only in spirit:** new feedback ⇒ new principle (or sharpen an
  existing one) with its incident, same session.
