## Who I am

I've spent more than five years working in government — the majority of that as a Job Order or Contract of Service employee. If you've worked in government long enough, you know what that means: you do the work, you carry the institutional knowledge, and you mostly do it without the plantilla, the benefits, or the job security that regular employees have. It's a strange place to be, and it gives you a particular kind of perspective on how things actually get done versus how they're supposed to get done.

Part of that work has been writing ISSPs — across two different agencies — and I've always been frustrated with how we actually fill these things out.

The process is exactly what you'd expect from a government compliance exercise: update each section manually, maintain a separate spreadsheet for the budget tables, copy numbers back and forth into the Word document, and hope nothing drifts out of sync before the submission deadline. It's tedious, error-prone, and honestly a bit demoralizing when you know the ISSP is supposed to be a genuine strategic document — not just a checkbox.

## Why I built this

I built this originally for my current agency. To be completely honest, the immediate trigger was a MITHI advisory requiring agencies to re-submit their ISSPs under new coverage requirements. We needed to move fast, and the usual Word template workflow wasn't going to cut it.

In May 2025, DICT issued Department Circular No. HRA-001 s. 2025, which mandated all government agencies to adopt unified ISSP standards. There is a quote in [this article](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1249217) saying *"the full suite of ISSP standards and related tools to support the transition is set to be available soon."*

It is now May 2026. The tools are still not publicly available.

This platform isn't a replacement for whatever DICT eventually releases — it's what exists right now, while agencies still need to submit ISSPs and the official tooling hasn't arrived yet. I genuinely hope DICT eventually builds something better and more official. In the meantime, this is here.

## The bigger picture

While building this, I kept thinking about the broader context.

Right now, people are demanding more transparency from government. Civtech movements are growing. And the tools available to builders — particularly AI — have dramatically lowered the cost of creating something meaningful. What used to take a team and a budget can now be put together by one person with a clear problem to solve.

ISSP data is public-interest data. These plans describe what agencies intend to do with ICT budgets — budgets funded by taxpayers. But that data is scattered across transparency portals, buried in PDFs, and practically impossible to compare or analyze at scale.

I think we can do better than that.

## The harder conversation

We're entering what everyone is calling the age of AI — agentic systems, autonomous workflows, and a dozen other buzzwords. Strip away the hype and the practical reality is simple: ICT spending in government is going to increase, significantly, for a long time. That makes what DICT does — and how it does it — more consequential than ever.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: a lot of government systems cost millions of pesos and barely work. I say this not as someone looking in from the outside, but as someone who has worked with and around these systems. The budget requests are submitted, the contracts are awarded, the ribbons are cut — and then the system handles 50 concurrent users before falling over. Some of these projects run into the hundreds of millions.

DICT should be the bastion of transparency on this. The mandate is already there in the eGov Act. ISSP data is one window into the picture — it won't fix everything, but making it structured, searchable, and publicly comparable is a foundation. If budget requests are visible and comparable across agencies and years, accountability follows.

## On talent, compensation, and what it actually takes

I'll say this plainly: if the government wants world-class ICT, it needs to hire and properly pay world-class talent.

I personally know government developers classified at SG-15 who could build circles around most of the private sector. The talent is there. What isn't always there is the recognition, the compensation, and the career trajectory that makes staying in government feel worth it long-term. That's a problem worth naming.

This platform is also an invitation — to other developers, architects, and ICT officers who are still inside government, *lingkod bayani* through and through. Your perspective is irreplaceable. You know which processes are broken. You know which systems are ghost projects. You know where the actual bottlenecks are, not just the ones that show up in audit reports.

Initiatives like [BetterGov](https://bettergov.ph/) have done important work getting the ball rolling from the outside. But those of us on the inside have something different to offer: we know the internal workflows, the procurement constraints, the organizational dynamics, and — most importantly — what would actually help.

## How it unfolds — three phases

**Phase 1 — ISSP Builder** *(live now)*

The first phase is what you're looking at: a structured, guided editor for crafting an ISSP. It aims to ease the burden on agencies while improving correctness: fields follow the DICT 2026 template, options are constrained where the template expects specific answers, budget tables calculate totals automatically, and the same structured data feeds both the editor and the PDF export. Less copy-pasting means fewer places for the numbers and narratives to drift.

**Phase 2 — ISSP Repository** *(coming soon)*

Once agencies are producing structured ISSPs on the platform, the next step is making that data publicly accessible — a centralized, searchable archive instead of scattered PDF uploads on transparency pages.

**Phase 3 — ICT Budget Dashboard** *(coming soon)*

The final phase connects ISSP budget requests to actual DBM releases, visualized across agencies and years. This is where government ICT spending becomes genuinely transparent — not just a number buried in a document, but a story you can actually follow.
